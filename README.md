BarelyACMS is a trivial content managment system designed to be simple to install and use. It is targeted towards web designers who have non-technical clients. 
It allows the developer to set up content containers that are editable by the end user, so that website maintenance is simple and straightforward. It has no database
requirements, and doesn't need any special design in order to fit inside a website. Just upload it, include a reference to the script, define content divs, and the page will be 
editable!
