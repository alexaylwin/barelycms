setup:
	- the whole UI
		- bucket properties
		- auto focus for adding blocks/buckets
	- admin password match verification
	
editor (ckeditor):
	-copy and paste <br /> into non-source view
		line break shows correctly in the non-source editor view, but 
		when content is echoed by load.php, <br /> is escaped
	
	- rich text vs. source adds a <p> tag
		when switching to rich text editor mode, ckeditor automatically
		wraps content in a paragraph element, causing unexpected output
		from load.php
	
loader.js
	- allow for bucket/block data attribute to be on the same element, ie:
		<div data-bac-bucket="index" data-bac-block="something"></div>

login/auth:
	idea: before setup, have setup.php outside of controlled folder
	after setup, delete the external php file. that way, cred.php can always
	be there with default credentials?
