					<h1>The Philsophy Behind BarelyACMS</h1>
					<p>
						BarelyACMS is a content management system written by Alex Aylwin. I wrote
						the product because I need a dead easy, quick content management system
						for small websites. As a web developer, I've been torn between giving the
						client the freedom of updating their own content, and using a CMS that 
						limits me in what I can design, what libraries I can use, and so on.
					</p>
					<p>
						BAC is essentially my way of breaking away from the CMS (read: Wordpress)
						Template model, where my site design is determined by how flexible the 
						templating system is, and how much time I want to spend working through
						the quirks of someone else's code. 
					</p>
					<p>
						The philosophy behind BAC is that it sits well out of the way of your markup
						and design, and just inserts content when it's needed. Ideally, you'll find
						that BAC gives you complete freedom over the look and feel of your website,
						and still lets you hand off a finished product to a client, saying "Here, now
						you manage content."
